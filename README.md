# JavaScript Number Guessing Game

A web-based number guessing game where the computer thinks of a number, and you try to guess it!

## Description

This project is a simple yet engaging number guessing game built with JavaScript. The server picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the player's goal is to guess this number. The game provides feedback on each guess, telling the player if their guess is too high or too low, until they correctly guess the number.
